- 👋 Hi, I’m @hdwhaley
- 👀 I’m interested in Arduino Programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UNO R3
- 💞️ I’m Working on a project to use Stepper to control knob on old wall air conditioner using temp sensors. Sensor 1 to monitor if cooling, Sensor 2 to monitor living room during day. Sensor 3 to monitor bedroom at night. Need to run cooler at night as air conditioner is in living room.
